## About The Project
Wordle is a word puzzle game that challenges players to guess a secret five-letter word within six attempts. After each guess, the player receives feedback on which letters are correct and in the right position (highlighted in green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (highlighted in yellow), and which letters are not in the word at all. It's a delightful mix of deduction and vocabulary skills, making each attempt a step closer to unraveling the mystery word.
